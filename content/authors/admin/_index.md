Iâ€™m a Data Scientist, passionate about utilizing my skills for purposes which will do good at some place on earth. I see data science as speaking with data in order to help companies to make informed business decisions. I am proficient in Python and R; I can wrangle data efficiently with both languages, train and deploy machine learning models.

For the past three years at Publicis Groupe as a Senior Data Scientist / DevOps Engineer I have been supporting multiple cross-functional teams by creating methodologies, gathering insights by analyzing datasets and presenting them to the related stakeholders. I also have been leading the productionization of in-house built tools by utilizing Microsoft Azure Tool Suite, Docker and Kubernetes in order to decrease runtimes from ~5 days to ~1 day

During my training at NYC Data Science Academy I worked with a variety of programming languages (R, Python mainly) and applied many machine learning algorithms on relatively large datasets ( >3GB and 74 million observations). I love dealing with large datasets and solving problems that require computational and analytical skills.
