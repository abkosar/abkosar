As a senior data scientist at Publicis New York I work in developing unique tools, analysis and quantification designs super-charging team efforts to meet their digital business objectives. I work within brand teams to uncover data insights, make recommendations for performance improvements, targeting strategies and lead data-decision making for our clients. Some of my recent achievements include:

- Managed and improved Data Science teams CI/CD pipeline for data scraping and storage. Used Azure kubernetes-as-a-service for web scraping in parallel which decreased time to completion from ~5 days to ~1 day

- Used Python to automate processing and merging 1000s of csv files. Decreased 8-20 hours/week of unnecessary labor for teammates

- Deployed a multi-label classification model for classifying long-form texts, using scikit-learn, achieved %70 accuracy among 1400 paragraphs

- Created a methodology and designed the algorithm for identifying and mapping spheres of influence within social media networks which generated more than $500k/year sales

- Built interactive web application, using R and the Shiny web framework, to integrate behavioral science with Data Science for strategic and creative testing which generated more than $200k/year.

- Analyzed MySQL data with R and used ggplot visualization framework to deliver insightful visualizations to stakeholders.
